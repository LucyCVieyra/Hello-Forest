# Hello-Forest

This is my third project using html and css. 

This HTML code establishes a basic structure with a main title, a message, and a button, while the CSS provides layout and styling. 
An image is used as the background for the main container, and the title style is modified to strike through the word "World" by introducing 
a span element and applying the text-decoration property.
